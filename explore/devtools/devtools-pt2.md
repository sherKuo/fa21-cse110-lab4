1. What was the bug? 
   The numbers were of the the wrong datatype. They were being concatenated as strings instead of having their values added like integers.  As a result 3+4 was giving 34 instead of 7.
2. How would you fix it? 
   I added a simple conversion for the num 1 and um 2 variables so that they add as numbers instead of being combined like strings.
